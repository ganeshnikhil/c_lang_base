#what is an array?
[*] An array is a collection of data items of the same type.
[*] items are stored at contgious memory locations.
[*] it can also store the collection of derived data types , such as pointers , structures , etc.
[*] a one dimesional array is like a list
[*] a two dimesional array is like a table.
[*] the c language places no limits on the number of dimensions in an array.
[*] some texts refer to one-dimensional arrays as vectors , two-dimensional arrays as matrices,
    and use the genral term arrays when the number of arrays when the number of dimensions is unspecified or unimportant

#why do we need array?
[*] code that use arrays is sometimes more organized and readable.
[*] if you were to store the  marks of 56 students , creating 56 variables will make program look 
    cluttered and messy.
[*] solution to this is array.
[*] we can create arrays of integers and store teh consecutive marks corresponding to the roll number 
    in the array.

#Advantage of array?
[*] it is used to repersent multiple data items of same type by using only single name.
[*] Accessing an item in a given array is very fast
[*] 2 Dimensional array makes it easy in mathemetical applications as it is used to repersent a matrix.

#propeties of array.
[*] data in an array is stored in contgious memory locations.
[*] each element of an array is of same size 
[*] any element of the array with given index can be accessed very quickly by using
