# Is string a datatype in c?
  [*] No
  [*] we have char,int,float and other data types but no 'string' data type in c
  [*] string is not a supported data type in C but it is a very useful concept used 
      to model real world entities like name , city etc.
  [*] We express strings using an array of characters terminated by a null character('\0')

[h  a  r  s  h \0]
 0  1  2  3  4  5
char name[];

[*] string: array of characters terminated by NULL character 
[*] strings in c is created by creating an array of characters 
[*] we need extra character ('\0' or null character) to tell the compiler that the stirng ends here.

# we can create a character array in the following ways:
 [*] char name[]='nikhil';
 [*] char name[]={'n','i','k','h','i','l'}
