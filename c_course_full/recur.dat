#Recusion in c
#What is a Recusive function.
[*] Recusersive fucntions or Recursion is a process when a function call a copy of itself to work on smaller problems
[*] Any function which calls itself is called recusion function
[*] This makes the life of programmer easy by dividing a given problem into easier
[*] A termination condition is imposed on such functions to stop them executing copies of themselves
[*] Any problem that can be solved recursively , can also be solved iteratively

#why recusion ?
[*] any problem that can be solved recusively , can also be solved itratively.
[*] however , some problems are best suited to be solved using recusion .
[*] for example , tower of hanoi,fibonacci series, factorial finding..etc 


[*] recursion is good approach when it comes to problem solving 
[*] however, programmer needs to evaluate the need and impact of using recursive/iterative approach
   while solving a particular problem
[*] In case of factorail calculation , reucursion saved a lot of lines of code .
[*] However in case of Fibonacci series, recursion resulted in some extra unnecessary function calls
    which was an extra overhead!
[*] Running time for Fibonacci series grows exponentially with input in case of recurisve approach
